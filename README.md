Quantification of the costs versus benefits of 5 selected NIST authentication policies

In the paper "Can we quantify the value of a security policy? A NIST Digital Guidelines Case study" we created a model that calculates the costs of enforcing authentication advice and the benefits the advice provides. The model computes the net value of an authentication policy by comparing the costs and benefits. To examine these models, we applied them to different versions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) authentication standards documents: the archived NIST 2003 Electronic Authentication Guidelines and the superseding NIST 2017 Digital Identity Guidelines. In this repository, we detail the methods and statistics used for assigning benefits and costs to these policies. For each of the NIST guideline documents, the policies are graded according to the strength of the security they seek to provide. The NIST 2017 document offers 3 policies starting at Level 1 and finishing at Level 3. NIST 2003, has 4 security levels. We will look at Level 1 and Level 3 of NIST 2017 and Level 1 and 4 of NIST 2003. We also look at an adapted version of the NIST 2003 Level 2 policy which we find in NIST 2007 documents.
